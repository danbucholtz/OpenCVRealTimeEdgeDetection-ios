# OpenCVRealTimeEdgeDetection-ios 

This is a super simple example of using OpenCV to detect edges (quadrangles in this case) within live video feed.  It is a purely academic solution to help understand how OpenCV works on iOS.  We are using canny filtering on top of some basic image process to detect the edges.
